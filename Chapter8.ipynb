      "## Nonlinear Root Finding - Bisection Method\n",
      "\n",
      "The bisection method, sometimes called the binary search method, is a simple method for finding the root, or zero, of a nonlinear equation with one unknown variable. (If the equation is lienar, we can solve for the root algebraically.)\n",
      "\n",
      "If we suppose $f$ is a continuous function defined on the interal $[a,b]$, with $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ of opposite sign (e.g., they appear on opposite sides of the root). There exists a point $p$ within the interval $[a,b]$ with $f(p) = 0$. We start the iteration by choosing a point halfway between $a$ and $b$ and checking the sign of $f(p)$. It will either have the same sign as $f(a)$ or $f(b)$. If the sign of $f(p)$ is the same as $f(a)$. Then $p$ gets set to $a$ and the process is repeated. If the sign of $f(p)$ is the same as $f(b)$, then $p$ gets set to $b$ and the process is repeated.\n",

      "The Biesection method has the advantage that as long as the root is bounded by the interval $[a,b]$, it will always converge. It has the disadvantage that convergence can be very slow and a good intermediate approximation to the root can be inadvertently discarded. This method is most useful when used to get an initial very rough approximation to a root and then combine it with a method that has faster convergence to get a better approximation to the root. We will talk about these other methods in the upcoming sections.\n",
