      "M$\\ddot{\\text{u}}$ller's method is a generalization of the secant method. Instead of doing a linear interpolation between two points we do a quadratic interpolation between three points. M$\\ddot{\\text{u}}$ller's method can be used to solve for the root of an arbitrary function much like Newton's method or Secant method, but it is particularly useful in solving for roots of polynomials. Since we are essentially solving the quadratic equation each time we can easily find complex roots. If using Newton's method an initial guess that is a real number will only converge to real numbers; however, when using M$\\ddot{\\text{u}}$ller's method an initial guess that is a real number will converge to a complex root if it is the closest.

      "## Deflation with M$\\ddot{\\text{u}}$ller's Method\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as we discussed the use of Newton's method with deflation we can use the same technique to solve for all the roots, both real and complex, of a polynomial using M$\\ddot{\\text{u}}$ller's method. We start with an initial guess to a root, solve for that root using M$\\ddot{\\text{u}}$ller's method, then use synthetic division to reduce the polynomial by one order and repeat the process. For a truly robust algorithm it is recommended that after finding the root of the deflation equation, one should go back and use the deflated root as an initial guess in the full polynomial. This ensures that the root is a root of the original polynomial not the deflated one and avoids the trouble of roundoff error."
