      "Unfortunately computers can't store numbers with infinite precision, but instead use an approximation that can be packed into a fixed number of bits.  These bits can be arranged to represent different data types usually called fixed point numbers or integers and floating point numbers.  Of most importance to us as numerical analysts are floating point numbers.  \n",
      "\n",
      "A floating point number is represented within the computer as a bit sign (positive or negative), an integer number representing the number of significant digits called the significand or mantissa, and an integer exponent.  Symbolically, we might write:\n",

      "$$\n",
      "\n",
      "where, $s$ is the sign, $M$ is the mantissa, $B$ is called the base usually $2$, but sometimes $10$ or $16$, and $E$ is the integer exponent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The smallest floating point number which, when added to the floating point number $1.0$, produces a result different than $1.0$ is called the machine precision or machine epsilon, $\\epsilon_{m}$.  Most modern computers have a machine epsilon value somewhere around $2^{-53}$ $(1.11 \\times 10^{-16})$, although $\\epsilon_{m}$ can range depending on the base and the bit wordlength (32-bit, 64-bit, etc.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost any arithmetic between floating point numbers will produce an additional fraction error of size $\\epsilon_{m}$, this error is called roundoff error.  Numpy has a special function that can report what $\\epsilon_{m}$ is for the machine we are using: "

      "## The Numerical Analyst's Enemy:  Roundoff Error\n",
      "\n",
      "Roundoff error, is a characteristic of computer hardware; however there is another type of error that is completely a result of the algorithm or software.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most numerical algorithms compute discrete approximations to a continuous desired quantity.  An example of this is the use of the Taylor series to approximate the function $\\sin{(x)}$. The Taylor series approximation of the function is as follows:\n",

      "\n",
      "Of course, this representation requires that the series be infinite for the solution to be exact.  Even the best computers cannot evaluate an infinite number of terms in the Taylor series therefore we must take a finite number of terms for the approximation.  The difference between the approximated answer and the exact solution is called the truncation error.  Let's take a look at some numerics, we all know that $\\sin{(\\frac{\\pi}{2})} = 1$.\n",
