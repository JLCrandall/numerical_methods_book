      "And we continue this process without changing the eigenvalues. The above process is called the *unshifted QR algorithm*, and almost always $A^{(k)}$ approaches a triangular form, its diagonal entries approach its eigenvalues, which are also the eigenalues of $A^{(0)}$. This algorithm is okay, but we can make it even better by using two refinements:\n",
      "\n",
      "  1. We allow shifts, in a similar fasion to the inverse power method. If the number $\\alpha^{(k)}$ is close to an eigenvalue, the step in $(\\ddagger)$ should be shifted as follows\n",
      "  \n",
      "  $A^{(k)} - \\alpha^{(k)}I = Q^{(k)}R^{(k)}$ and then $A^{(k+1)} = R^{(k)}Q^{(k)} + \\alpha^{(k)}I$\n",
      "  \n",
      "  One popular method of choosing the shifted constant, $\\alpha^{(k)}$ is to simply use the $a_{nn}^{(k)}$ entry of the matrix. Another method uses a shifting constant that is the eignevalue of the matrix\n",

      "  \n",
      "  After a few iteration the matrix $A^{(k)}$ will come to look as follows:\n",
      "  \n",
      "  $A^{(k)} = \\begin{pmatrix} * & * & * & * \\\\ * & * & * & * \\\\ 0 & * & * & * \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\in & \\mu_1 \\end{pmatrix}$, where $\\in << 1$.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  $\\mu_1$ will be accepted as $\\lambda_1$. We will find the next eigenvalue by eliminating the last row and column and performing the same procedure with the smaller submatrix. And continue untill all eigenvalues have been found. At this point the $QR$ algorithm is completely described. If the eigenvectors are desired they are one step away with an inverse power method using the eigenvalues found here.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  &nbsp;\n",
      "  \n",
      "  2. The last thing we can do to greatly improve the $QR$ algorithm is to make the $QR$ factorization very fast at each step. This is where our old friend the Housholder transformation comes in. It turns out that the $QR$ factorization genearlly takes $O(n^3)$ operations, however for a matrix that is already in tridiagonal form this becomes $O(n)$ and once the matrix $A^{(0)}$ is in tridiagonal form, each $A^{(k)}$ will stay that way at each step."
