      "Householder's Method is a similarity transform. We will use it to find the eigenvalues of a matrix, but it has other uses outside this process. The method is used to find a symmetric tridiagonal matrix $B$ which is similar to a given symmetric matrix $A$. We'll start by defining the *Householder Transformation*:\n",
